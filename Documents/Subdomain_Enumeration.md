<h1 align="center">Subdomain Enumeration</h1>

Finding subdomains used by the target organization is an effective way to increase the attack surface and discover more vulnerabilities.

The script will use a list of potential subdomains and prepends them to the domain name provided via a command-line argument.

The script then tries to connect to the subdomains and assumes the ones that accept the connection exist.


    import requests 
    import sys 
    
    sub_list = open("subdomains.txt").read() 
    subdoms = sub_list.splitlines()
    
    for sub in subdoms:
        sub_domains = f"http://{sub}.{sys.argv[1]}" 

    try:
        requests.get(sub_domains)
    
    except requests.ConnectionError: 
        pass
    
    else:
        print("Valid domain: ",sub_domains) 



As you can see, the script will search for a file named `subdomains.txt`. You can use this [wordlist.txt](https://github.com/fsn4k3/Python-for-Pentesters/blob/main/Documents/wordlist.txt) . The wordlist should have possible subdomains listed one per line.
