# File Downloader

Wget on Linux systems or Certutil on Windows are useful tools to download files.

Python can also be used for the same purpose.

The code :

    import requests
    
    url = 'https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/THMlogo.png'
    r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
    open('THMlogo.png', 'wb').write(r.content)

This short piece of code can easily be adapted to retrieve any other type of file, as seen below :

    import requests
    
    url = 'https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip'
    r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
    open('PSTools.zip', 'wb').write(r.content)  

﻿﻿PSexec allow system administrators to run commands on remote Windows systems. We see that PSexec is also used in cyber attacks as it is usually not detected by antivirus software. You can learn more about PSexec here and read this blogpost about its use by attackers.
