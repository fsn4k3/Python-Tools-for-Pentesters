As it is often pointed out, reconnaissance is one of the most critical steps to the success of a penetration testing engagement. Once subdomains have been discovered, the next step would be to find directories.

The following code will build a simple directory enumeration tool.

      root@ip-10-10-219-252:~# python3 direnum.py 10.10.99.87
      Valid directory: http://10.10.99.87/surfer.html
      Valid directory: http://10.10.99.87/private.html
      Valid directory: http://10.10.99.87/apollo.html
      Valid directory: http://10.10.99.87/index.html
