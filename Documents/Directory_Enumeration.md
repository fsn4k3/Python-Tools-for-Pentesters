As it is often pointed out, reconnaissance is one of the most critical steps to the success of a penetration testing engagement. Once subdomains have been discovered, the next step would be to find directories.

The following code will build a simple directory enumeration tool.

      import requests 
      import sys 
      
      sub_list = open("[wordlist.txt](https://github.com/fsn4k3/Python-for-Pentesters/blob/main/Documents/wordlist.txt)").read() 
      directories = sub_list.splitlines()
      
      for dir in directories:
          dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html" 
          r = requests.get(dir_enum)
          if r.status_code==404: 
              pass
          else:
              print("Valid directory:" ,dir_enum)

You can you this [Wordlist](https://github.com/fsn4k3/Python-for-Pentesters/blob/main/Documents/wordlist.txt)

At first glance, you will certainly notice the similarities with the subdomain enumeration script. This script takes an approach based on a for loop and passes all "404" responses.
