<h1 align="center">Network Scanner</h1>

Python can be used to build a simple `ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)` scanner to identify potential targets on the network. However, ICMP packets can be monitored or blocked as the target organization would not expect a regular user to “ping a server”. On the other hand, systems can be configured to not respond to ICMP requests. These are the main reasons why using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify targets on the local network is more effective.

The code :

    from scapy.all import *
    
    interface = "eth0"
    ip_range = "10.10.X.X/24"
    broadcastMac = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"
    
    packet = Ether(dst=broadcastMac)/ARP(pdst = ip_range) 
    
    ans, unans = srp(packet, timeout =2, iface=interface, inter=0.1)
    
    for send,receive in ans:
            print (receive.sprintf(r"%Ether.src% - %ARP.psrc%"))     


You will need to install `Scapy` first. This can easily be done using the `apt install python3-scapy` command.


    root@ip-10-10-219-252:~# python3 arp_scan.py 
    Begin emission:
    Finished sending 256 packets.
    ..........................................................................................................................

And you will see all results here if you got any answers.
