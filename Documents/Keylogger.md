Modules allow us to solve relatively difficult problems in a simple way.

A good example is the “keyboard” module, which allows us to interact with the keyboard.

If the `keyboard` module is not available on your system, we can use pip3 to install it.
`pip3 install keyboard`  

Using the keyboard module, the following three lines of code would be enough to record and replay keys pressed:


    import keyboard
    keys = keyboard.record(until ='ENTER')
    keyboard.play(keys)

`keyboard.record` will record the keys until ENTER is pressed, and `keyboard.play` will replay them. As this script is logging keystrokes, any edit using backspace will also be seen.
