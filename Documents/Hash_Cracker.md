# Hash Cracker


A Hash is often used to safeguard passwords and other important data. As a penetration tester, you may need to find the cleartext value for several different hashes. The Hash library in Python allows you to build hash crackers according to your requirements quickly.

Hashlib is a powerful module that supports a wide range of algorithms.
