# Hash Cracker


A Hash is often used to safeguard passwords and other important data. As a penetration tester, you may need to find the cleartext value for several different hashes. The Hash library in Python allows you to build hash crackers according to your requirements quickly.

Hashlib is a powerful module that supports a wide range of algorithms.

Leaving aside some of the more exotic ones you will see in the list above, hashlib will support most of the commonly used hashing algorithms.

### Hash Cracker Code :


    import hashlib
    import pyfiglet
    
    ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \n HASH CRACKER for MD 5")
    print(ascii_banner)
    
    wordlist_location = str(input('Enter wordlist file location: '))
    hash_input = str(input('Enter hash to be cracked: '))
    
    with open(wordlist_location, 'r') as file:
        for line in file.readlines():
            hash_ob = hashlib.md5(line.strip().encode())
            hashed_pass = hash_ob.hexdigest()
            if hashed_pass == hash_input:
                print('Found cleartext password! ' + line.strip())
                exit(0)


This script will require two inputs: the location of the wordlist and the hash value.

As you probably know, hash values can not be cracked as they do not contain the cleartext value. Unlike encrypted values that can be "reversed" (e.g. decrypted), cleartext values for hashes can only be found starting with a list of potential cleartext values. A simplified process can be seen below ;

- You retrieve the hash value "eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3" from a database, which you suspect is the hash for a number between 1 and 5.
- You create a file with possible cleartext values (numbers from 1 to 5)
- You generate a list of hashes for values in the cleartext list (Hash values for numbers between 1 and 5)
- You compare the generated hash with the hash value at hand (Matches hash value of the number 3)
